## KEY HIGHLIGHTS  

- **Award‑Winning Innovator**  
  Secured 2nd Place at the 2024 International ICT Innovative Services Awards for “SilverCareHousing – Privacy‑Enhanced Elderly Housing and Care Needs Analysis,” demonstrating exceptional problem‑solving and data‑privacy skills 

- **End‑to‑End UVM Verification Environment**  
  Designed and implemented a comprehensive UVM testbench integrating APB, AHB, and DMA protocol agents, custom sequences/drivers/monitors, assertion modules, and a dual‑layer coverage strategy (transaction‑ and signal‑level), ensuring robust multi‑protocol concurrency and error‑injection validation 

- **Automated Build & Coverage Flow via Makefile**  
  Developed a unified Makefile pipeline for Synopsys VCS UVM‑1.2 that automates RTL and testbench compilation, simulation execution, and coverage report generation—streamlining verification cycles and enhancing reproducibility

- **Dynamic Privacy–Performance Synthetic Data Pipeline**  
  Engineered a Python‑based data‑processing framework combining k‑anonymity, l‑diversity, and dynamic ε differential privacy with a custom VAE–GAN synthesis model. Validated privacy‑utility trade‑offs via Silhouette Score, linkage‑attack metrics, and attribute‑correlation analysis, achieving ≥ 97 % downstream model accuracy while markedly reducing re‑identification risk

- **FPGA‑Accelerated LLM Inference Framework**  
  Independently delivered a hardware‑software co‑design accelerator for large‑language‑model inference on FPGA, featuring hierarchical memory optimization, pipelined matrix/vector processing units, and quantization techniques, yielding significant throughput and energy‑efficiency gains
